Credit card spending visibility from your statements, with no manual entry

Credit card holders have no clear view of what they spend. Entering transactions by hand is a chore, so it never gets done. The owner has this problem and so do their friends. Statements already contain every transaction, but they arrive as password-protected PDFs or as emails, and nothing turns them into usable data. Evidence: first-hand need from the owner and friends. No market numbers have been gathered, and none are claimed here.

## Where things are
- `design/` is the design library: `brief.md`, `ux.md`, and `screens/S01-name/` (`screen.png` + `spec.md`, plus
  `states/*.png` for empty, error and other states). Screens have permanent IDs (S01, S02, ...). Tickets name the
  screens they build by ID. **Read the spec and look at the screenshot of every screen you build**; `ux.md` has the
  colors, type and spacing. Don't edit `design/`; the designer owns it.
- Design canvas (private and behind a login, so you can't open it; it's where the design gets reviewed): <!-- canvas -->not published yet<!-- /canvas -->
- Source code lives outside `design/`. Put it where the stack below says.

## Stack
<!-- stack -->
_Not decided yet. The architect picks it in the technical design; this fills in when you approve it._
<!-- /stack -->

## How we work here
- Two long-lived branches: `develop` is where the work lands (every ticket's PR goes there); `master` is the
  release branch and only moves when the maintainer launches a release. Never commit to `master`.
- One ticket at a time, on its own branch (`dmi/t-<n>`), cut from `develop`. Small, focused changes.
- Each ticket becomes a pull request into `develop` that the maintainer reviews. Keep the diff small enough to read in one sitting.
- Prefer boring, proven tools. Don't add a dependency unless the ticket needs it.
- Keep platform-specific code thin and put logic in pure code with unit tests (aim for about 90% coverage). Code
  that can't run in the sandbox is verified by review plus those tests, and then by hand by the maintainer.
- Write tests for what you build, and run them before you say you're done. Document the build and test commands in the README under "Development".
- Never commit secrets, tokens or personal data. Don't put real credentials in examples.
- If the ticket is unclear or the design is missing something, ask the architect or designer instead of guessing.
